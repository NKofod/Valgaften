\section{Concluding Remarks}

The results from the research suggest a possible correlation between the corona outbreaks with the temperature above the ground variable along with a possible correlation with the total precipitation variable. Although total precipitation has a significant impact on the cases per region, we observed that the temperature above ground impacted the variable more according to the Pearson correlation. On the contrary,  every result pointed to total precipitation as the most correlated variable confirming our hypothesis. However, it is likely that the weather only impacts the social behavior of people in the Netherlands and does not actually provide a better environment for the spread of the virus. It is important to note that our research has many limitations, hence we do not recommend our results to be used for any further research.

Research conducted is not completely flawless, so its findings should be taken into account with careful consideration. The future works in this area can be based on the coefficients describing the relationship between weather as well as inspecting the unconsidered factors such as humidity.
