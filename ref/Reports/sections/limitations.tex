\section{Limitations}

During the research we encountered several obstacles that could be a deterring factor in the validity of our results. Firstly, the analysed data set lacked the number of covid tests carried out. This could potentially make the number of cases irrelevant. However, the number of deaths and hospitalizations remain an objective indicator that is independent of the missing values. 

Some of the values were dropped during the merging of data due to technicalities. This could have a negative impact on the scope of data. Specifically, 204 rows of the original data set were dropped. 

Another issue we stumbled upon were the missing values in stringency index, which might limit the accuracy of the measurements that we used to correlate the measure of covid cases and the environmental factors. % If we're not doing anything with regards to the Government Interventions in the report, then this is not a limitation. 

Finally, we didn't have any information regarding government regulations introduced during the outbreaks of covid, such as lockdowns, which could limit the exposure of people to environmental factors. % Perhaps reword to be more along the lines of: "Finally, we didn't adjust for external interventions, eg. Government Interventions, which could also play a role.
